# Homepage (deployment, Jimmy / Sophia):

  1. Get into how we started figuring out Heroku and the bugs we had
  2. Procfile & directory structure
  3. requirements.txt & library conflicts
  4. Aptfile & system libraries
  5. Talk about domain name (reci.tech)
  
# Record/Upload Page (Bugs, Ziyi):

  1. Talk about how the ML model requires an audio to be > 2.5 seconds and how we added the popup, 
  
  start with a recording that’s too short to showcase this popup
  
  2. Save to disc button: <button> to <a>
  3. Talk about how our upload button didn’t work at the start, maybe Jimmy could go into this bc he fixed it as he record the correct thing (front-end-back-end comms with cookies)

# Results Page (Future steps, Sofia):
  
  1. New design (colour palette) that does not look like any other Bootstrap app
  2. Migrate to React for expandability
