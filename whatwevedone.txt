Our three main points for this project:
  Get our project onto the World Wide Web instead of locally hosted
  Register a domain name and change our project to that
  Make our website look and function better with React and Flask
  
Day one:
  We went onto Heroku and followed their tutorial to shift our website from locally hosted to global
  We got stuck because some of the libraries didn't function properly on Heroku
  We ended the day debugging this and successfully deploying/building this site, and changed the requirements 
  so that the correct version of python was used and all the necessary libraries were added.
  
Day two:
  Although we deployed this, the application still wasn't working due to a root error. This meant a restructuring of the github to properly match what was needed.
  Along with this restructuring, we worked on acquiring the .tech domain in order to match them
  We ended the day getting the website deployed and ready to attach the .tech domain to
  
Day three:
  We are working on making the slide deck for the presentations
  Our goals for today is to attach the proper domain name to the website and change the React on the website for a better front end look.
